# Capstone-Project---Machine-Learning-with-Python
## Description
The following algorithms are used to build models for the different datasets: k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression. The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable: Jaccard index, F1-score, Log Loss.
